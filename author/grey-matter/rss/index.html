<p>The U.S. recently lead a assault on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/">ISIS operations</a>.  Why?  Because ISIS has developed a nasty habit of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2729287/ISIS-beheads-missing-American-journalist-James-Wright-Foley.html">removing</a> American heads from American bodies.  As the U.S. retaliation flooded the news, one specific fact nugget within the attack details kept popping up.  This was the U.S.’s <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/23/syria-air-strikes-f-22-raptor/16105291/">first use</a> of the stealth F-22 Raptor, the deadly result of a $67 billion stealth fighter program.  Up until this ISIS mission, the Raptors remained quaranteaned to <a href="https://img1.etsystatic.com/022/0/6956801/il_570xN.474893531_903s.jpg">Jurassic Park</a> doing a lot of nothing.  These scary-ass, invisble planes entered service a whopping nine years ago in 2005 (or twelve years after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng">Jurassic Park</a> hit theaters).  Military leaders simply said that up until now the Raptors didn’t make sense in previous engagements.  Huh, I guess the eight year-long Iraq War was humming along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Iraq_War">just fine</a> without the addition of a few stealth, multi-purpose fighter jets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.superfunnyimages.com/meanwhile-in-russia-7/">Russia</a> has decided to copy Hollywood and reboot the Cold War.  Russia's very own <a href="http://time.com/2938446/vladimir-putin-james-bond-lair/">Bond villain</a> turned President, Vladimir Putin, has decided he misses the bygone days of the USSR and has interest in reliving the past with some casual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation">nation annexing</a>.  Despite U.S. sanctions against Russia, Putin went <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/29/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">full retard</a> by reminding the world Russia is a nuclear power and doesn’t really mind using them.  Clearly he missed the villain lecture discussing the realities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">mutually assured destruction</a> and the joy of mounting lasers to sharks. With the increasing global upheaval, I wonder if the U.S. military decided to put the Raptors to work as a big middle finger to Russia and a reminder that the U.S. spends roughly $640 billion on defense, more than the next <a href="http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison">EIGHT</a> countries combined.  So there you go world, say hello to <a href="http://archive.redstate.com/blogs/patriotroom/2008/apr/30/the_invisible_f_22_raptor_will_kill_em_all">invisible fighter jets</a>.  You’re welcome.  </p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/say-hello-to-invisible-fighter-jets/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">da2b2f92-0236-4323-a321-848a5a3c922e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Grey Matter]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 21:45:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
